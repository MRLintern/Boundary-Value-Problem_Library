## Introduction

This repository contains a `CMakeLists.txt` file. An alternative to using `make`.
All data generated by the library will be placed inside this repository.

## Instructions 1

    $ cmake ..
    $ cmake --build .

    $ mkdir -p build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cmake --build .
    $ ./Driver
